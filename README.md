# golang_project_01_server

Hello!

To run the graphql server, run the main.go file in the root of this project

GraphQl related files are in the graphql directory(schema, resolvers, models, middleware) 

-practice directory has files that I used to test things out
-routes is older code where we used json instead of Nexient APIs, and old server
